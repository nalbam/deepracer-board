# Project Code Guidelines

## Core Principles

- **Solve the right problem**: Avoid unnecessary complexity or scope creep.
- **Favor standard solutions**: Use well-known libraries and documented patterns before writing custom code.
- **Keep code clean and readable**: Use clear naming, logical structure, and avoid deeply nested logic.
- **Ensure consistent style**: Apply formatters (e.g. Prettier, Black) and linters (e.g. ESLint, Flake8) across the codebase.
- **Handle errors thoughtfully**: Consider edge cases and fail gracefully.
- **Comment with intent**: Use comments to clarify non-obvious logic. Prefer expressive code over excessive comments.
- **Design for change**: Structure code to be modular and adaptable to future changes.
- **Keep dependencies shallow**: Minimize tight coupling between modules. Maintain clear boundaries.
- **Fail fast and visibly**: Surface errors early with meaningful messages or logs.
- **Automate where practical**: Use automation for formatting, testing, and deployment to reduce manual effort and error.

## Documentation Standards

- Keep all documentation up to date and version-controlled.
- Each document should serve a clear purpose:

### `README.md`
- Project overview and purpose
- Setup and installation steps
- Usage instructions or examples

### `ARCHITECTURE.md`
- High-level system design
- Major components and their responsibilities
- Data flow and integration points

## Testing Strategy

- Write comprehensive unit tests for individual functions and modules
- Implement integration tests to verify component interactions
- Ensure adequate test coverage for critical code paths
- Set up automated testing as part of the development workflow
